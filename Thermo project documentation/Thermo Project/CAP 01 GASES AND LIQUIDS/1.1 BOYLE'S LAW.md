In 1662, Robert Boyle noted that the volume of a gas at constant temperature decreases when the pressure increases. This important generalization is known as Boyle's Law. It is expressed in mathematically way: 
$$ V \text{  }\alpha \text{  } \frac{1}{P}  $$ or
$$ V=\frac{K_1}{P} $$
Where V is the volume and P is the pressure of the gas, while K1 is a proportionality factor whose value depends on the temperature, the weight of the gas his nature, and the units used to express, P and V.
